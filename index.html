          <p id='salmon-info'>
          Environmental groups such as Seafood Watch and the Environmental Defense Fund,
          have put nearly all farmed salmon on their &#34red&#34 or &#34avoid&#34 list.
          The reason: many farms use crowded pens where salmon are easily infected
          with lice, may be treated with antibiotics and can spread disease to wild fish
          &#40one reason Alaska has banned salmon farms&#41. In addition, it can take as
          much as three pounds of wild fish &#40and fishmeal&#41 to raise one pound of salmon.

            &nbsp &nbsp One of the main reasons I buy Salmon Cookies is because the calorie count is 180,
            keeping me under my 200 breakfast limit that I try to keep.
            They actually taste like an oatmeal cookie and are sooo yummy.
             Upon opening the package, they don't seem terribly large, but one cookie really does fill me up.
             I love these things and wish they were easier to find.
             I was thrilled to see them available for Prime Pantry. These breakfast cookies are perfect for on the go and this was the easy breakfast of choice when my family go on vacation.
